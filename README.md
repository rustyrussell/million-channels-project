# million-channels-project
Creating a test corpus for a lightning network with 1M public channels

The project has several parts:

1. powerLawReg.py: rough analysis of the current lightning network: number of
   (public) channels, number of nodes, distribution of channels by
   node, and distribution of channels in blocks. 

2. buildNetwork.py: Applies a scaling factor to make a similar network on regtest

3. gossip.py (incomplete): Generates all the gossip generated by that network.

4. scrapeConnectedNodes.py: Connects to nodes in lightning network that are scraped from node files


The goal of this project is to create a test network with an accurate topology extrapolated from the current topology. 
This network will be used for testing routing algorithms and channel syncing.
