# million-channels-project
Creating a test corpus for a lightning network with 1M public channels

The project has several parts:

1. powerLawReg.py: rough analysis of the current lightning network: number of
   (public) channels, number of nodes, distribution of channels by
   node, and distribution of channels in blocks. 

2. buildNetwork.py: Applies a scaling factor to make a similar network on regtest

3. gossip.py (very incomplete): Generates all the gossip generated by that network.
    1. python3 gossip.py
    2. You MUST use this fork of c-lightning: https://github.com/nettijoe96/lightning 
    3. Compile with:
`./configure --enable-MCP`
    4. move gossip generated by gossip.py into your .lightning data directory for some nodeA (on regtest)
    5. run nodeA
    6. run some nodeB (on regtest)
    7. connect nodeA and nodeB 

4. scrapeConnectedNodes.py: Connects to nodes in lightning network that are scraped from node files


The goal of this project is to create a test network with an accurate topology extrapolated from the current topology. 
This network will be used for testing routing algorithms and channel syncing.
