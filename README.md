Creating a test corpus for a lightning network with 1M public channels

The project has several parts:

1. Do some rough analysis of the current lightning network: number of
   (public) channels, number of nodes, distribution of channels by
   node, and distribution of channels in blocks.

2. Apply a scaling factor to make a similar network on regtest,
   preferably in a reproducible manner. This would be the corpus.

3. Write a program to generate all the gossip generated by that network.

4. Feed the gossip into a test node and watch it die horribly.

5. Fix the bottlenecks in each implementation :)

Contributions welcome!
